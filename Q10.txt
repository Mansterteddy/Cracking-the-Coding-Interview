1. You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play 1 of 2 games.
Game #1: You get one shot to make the hoop
Game #2: You get three shot and you have to make 2 of 3 shots
If p is the probability of making aparticular shot, for which values of p should you pick one game or the other?

对于游戏1，赢的概率是p
对于游戏2，赢的概率是p^2 + p * (1 - p) * p + (1 - p) * p * p = 3p^2 - 2 * p^3
假如1/2 < p < 1, 游戏2赢的概率大
假如0 < p < 1/2, 游戏1赢的概率大

2. These are three ants on different vertices of a triangle.
What is the probabili1 of collision (between any two or all of them)
if they start walking on the sides of the triangle?
Similarly find the probabili1 of collision with 'n' ants on an 'n' vertex polygon.

3. Givn two lines on a Cartesian plane, determine whether the two lines would intersect.

4. Write a method to implement *, -, / operations. You should use only the + operator.

5. Given two squares on a two dimensional plane, find a line that would cut these two squares in half.

6. Given a two dimensional graph with points on it, find a line which passes the most number of points.  

7. Design an algorithm to find the kth number such that the only prime factors are 3, 5, 7.
